For the technical portion of your interview, weâ€™d like you to run through an assignment that is meant to give us some common ground for a technical conversation.  

We expect this assignment to take no more than 4 hours. When completed, please submit the following:
- A public git repo containing your code
- Your container's public image tag
    - [Docker hub](https://hub.docker.com/) is a great option
